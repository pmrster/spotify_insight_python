# My Spotify insightðŸŽ§

This project is my tiny web app that will provide users with their Spotify listening habits insight using **python, flask, jinja (with a little bit HTML/CSS), and spotify web API** to get spotify data, analyse, and display insight. This was built from desire of knowing my music listening behavior by not just waiting for official SpotifyWrapped at the end of each year.
